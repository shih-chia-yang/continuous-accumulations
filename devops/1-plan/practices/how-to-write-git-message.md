團隊的git commit message應該要有統一的風格，使開發者容易閱讀辨別重要的訊息，成員需對以下3件事有共識並實作，可以減少提交訊息的混亂不一致，提升效率。

1. **Style** : markup syntax , warp margins,grammar,capitalization , punctuation.spell these things out,remove the guesswork, and make it all as simple as possible. the end result will be a remarkably consistent log that's not only a pleasure to read but the actually does get read on a regular basis.

2. **Content** : what kind of information should the body of the commit message (if any ) contain ? what should it not contain ?

3. **Metadata** : how should issue tracking IDs , pull request numbers, etc. be referenced ? 

## 7 rules of great git commit message

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- limit the subject line to 50 characters
- capitalize the subject line
- do not end the subject line with a period
- use the imperative mood in the subject line
- wrap the body at 72 characters
- use the body to explain what and why vs. how
