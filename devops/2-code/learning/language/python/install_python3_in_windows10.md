[[powershell]]

[[python]]

1. opening and configure powershell

```dos
pwsh
```

- go to current user folder /Users/`<your name>`
```powershell
cd ~
```

Configured to run in the most secure mode by default, there are a few levels of permissions that you can set up as an administrator:

- Restricted is the default execution policy, under this mode you will not be able to run scripts, and PowerShell will work only as an interactive shell.

- AllSigned will enable you to run all scripts and configuration files that are signed by a trusted publisher, meaning that you could potentially open your machine up to the risk of running malicious scripts that happen to be signed by a trusted publisher.

- RemoteSigned will let you run scripts and configuration files downloaded from the internet signed by trusted publishers, again opening your machine up to vulnerabilities if these trusted scripts are actually malicious.

- Unrestricted will run all scripts and configuration files downloaded from the internet as soon as you confirm that you understand that the file was downloaded from the internet. In this case no digital signature is required so you could be opening your machine up to the risk of running unsigned and potentially malicious scripts downloaded from the internet.


```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser
RemoteSigned
```

- confirm current permissions

```powershell
    Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

```
