# scaling

two man approaches to scaling an application or systems

- scaling-up
    1. existing hardware can be upgraded.
    2. replacing current server with more power full new server
    3. scaling up improve task performance that are capable of running parallel execution.async executed tasks
    4. scaling up has an architectural limitation for a monolithic system 

- scaling-out
    1. scaling out accomplish adding more systems to spread application processing load across multiple servers.
    2. scaling out works best for handing increased in workload and demand for growth.
