# what is web service

- a web service is a kind of software that is accessible on the internet.
- it makes use of the XML messaging system and offers an easy to understand interface for the end users
- APIs heavily used as services.
- service oriented architectures(SOA) and micro services

- for us service orientation means encapsulating the data with the business logic that operate on the data,with the only access through a published service interface. no direct database access is allowed from outside the service , and there's no data sharing among the services
