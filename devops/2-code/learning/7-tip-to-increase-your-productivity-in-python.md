1. choosing your IDE for the particular project
    - these are three main editor that i use on a regular basis
    1. Pycharm
    2. Jupyter Notebook
    3. Visual Studio Code
2. Using list comprehensions
3. Better Use of classes and functions
    - classes are great when you need to represent a collection of attributes and methods that will be used repeatedly in other places
    - functions are great to use when data is critical to the work being done
    - if you end up writing functions inside of functions you should consider writing a class instead. if you only have one function in a class then better stick with just writing a function.
    - a  good reason to move from functions to classes in your programming is to write classes using composition over inheritance
4. google search is your best friend while debugging
5. Anonymous functions and operations
6. interact with the community
7. keep practicing and work on more projects
